### Media Modules ###

Media modules define the over all layout, the templates for headlines, text
areas, photos and other content items, styles, and scripts as well as other
parameters. Layout modules are useful for additional flexability and
customization of output.

A default media module is include, which is useful for getting started, and
may cover all of your needs. This is located at etc/default_layout.

Note: Media modules may be refered to as layout modules, layouts or templates.
Not to be confused with other templates or layouts, such as those which are a
part of rails.

To add a media module, update or create the config/media_modules.yml file with
the name you will use to identify it, and path attribute which points to it's
location on disk.

For example

    # File: config/media_modules.yml
    ---
    vanilla:
      path: ../layouts/vanilla

This would indicate that there is a media module located at ../layouts/vanilla
(relative to the root of the project), and that it should be refered to as
vanilla.

Media modules follow a basic structure.

    config.yml    # Attributes which are passed to Newstime
    fonts/        # Fonts which are used in the media module
    images/       # Images provided by the media module
    javascripts/  # Javascript which can use coffee or other preprocessing
    stylesheets/  # Css style sheets, may use css or scss
    templates/    # Html templates which use erb or other templateing languages


To get an idea of what is in a media module and the flexablity it provides,
check out the default one at etc/default_layout.
