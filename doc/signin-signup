Sign-in/Sign-up
================

It is vitally important that users can sign-up
for the Dreamtool website, as well as sign in.

These two services should never be interrupted unless
absolutly unavoidable, which should seldom if ever be
the case.

Beyound offering a friendly/awesome signup process
and a friendly and awesome sign in, much of the site
should remain free of use to users who wish to remain
annonomous and forego a sign in or sign up.

With that said, we wish to make it benificial to the user
to maintain an account with us through value added services
and enhancements.

We believe that signing up for the site is a personal investment
in our future.

Sign up should be secure, fun and free.

Signing in, likewise, should be end to end secure and be without
exposing the user to any vulnerabilities. It should be simple and
painless.

Passwords, if used as a means of authentication should remain within
the user's domain, and with the user's consent. All sensitive data must
be stored according to best known security practicies.
