## Boundry

Much of the Newstime editor app comes down to the canvas, and the interworking
of boundries.

The boundry object is used to represent a rectangular portion of the screen, and
can be used for comparison, detection, and other operations.

[Newstime.Boundry](/app/assets/javascripts/composer/models/boundry.js.coffee) is
the standard object that should be used to represent a boundry application wide.
