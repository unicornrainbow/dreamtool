## Known Issues ##

- Photos are not cropped correctly in Safari. The cropping works fine in Chrome,
  which supports the object-fit: cover css style. Ideally we could support the
  newer, more convient standard while still falling back to support the older
  browser. A more advanced photo view, which cropping and panning would likely
  overcome this issue. Additonally, and with support for cropping an panning,
  the compiler should adjudicate the images, cropping and sizing the
  specifically as needed for the final "print out".
