When starting up the Rails environment the following
warning message is printed out.

    Unsupported rails environment for compass

Ideal Conditon:
  No warning message to be printed. More so, no warning
condition to exist. If there is a warning condition, than
it is good we are being warned. SO why are we being warned?
How is this an unsupported compass environment. Is compass
still active in the project?

  [ ] Address warning message.
